			“As We May Think” is an essay by Vannevar Bush published in 1945 predicting the advancements of technology and science. I was highly impressed by the accuracy of many of Bush’s predictions. Though it is clear that conceptualizing things with such broad capabilities as the modern-day smartphone, graphing calculators, and even polaroid cameras (which are now considered outdated) was very difficult for Bush, he was able to explain the general concept very well. One of the most striking is featured at the top of the Atlantic article: “Consider a future device …  in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory,” (Bush). In this day and age, we are very familiar with these devices. Kindles, iPhones, memory cards, etc, are all a part of our daily lives. It is interesting to think about how life was without all of that information at our fingertips; a world that required us to look through hand-written records to find important information.

			Bush also comments on how science is rapidly advancing, but that we must find a better way of storing a record of important breakthroughs so that we may continue to consult them. Indexing was one of his primary concerns. He believed that there should be a way to catalog items and bring them up based on association. The human brain doesn’t store information in alphabetical or numerical order, but rather by association. Bush anticipated a way of “searching” for or through books and newspapers by keywords, which we all know is entirely possible and simple today. Lots of Bush’s predictions were based on using technology that existed in his time in a more advanced way. He thought of general solutions that have become standard over the course of the last 75 years.
