			“Long Live the Web” by Tim Berners-Lee is a very important and intriguing article about the power of the manipulation of the Internet. Many people, including myself, don’t know the difference between the Web and the Internet and applications. There are separate layers that all play a role in how we use each one. Primarily, we use the Web which is an application on the Internet. When the internet was invented, it was much harder to manipulate. However, today, we experience large companies like Comcast do it regularly. I was shocked to learn that when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was informed of such actions by Comcast against BitTorrent, it was ruled in federal court that the FCC could not require Comcast to stop slowing traffic on the BitTorrent application.

			<p>Another important factor that I previously knew very little about is Net Neutrality. Net Neutrality is very important in situations where a user pays for certain speeds/services and an Internet provider purposefully performs at a lower rate on sites/applications that they don’t own in order to “encourage” the user to use their products. I believe that this is an incredibly discriminatory power that Internet providers possess and only envision an eventual monopoly. I see the importance of upholding the basic principles of the Web. The power will remain in the hands of the users so long as they continue to take advantage of their rights and continue innovating.
