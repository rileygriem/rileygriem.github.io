		<h1>John Berger Response</h1>
		<h2>Riley Griem</h2>

		<p>
		In my Junior year of high school, I studied the painting <b>Guernica</b> by Pablo Picasso for a few weeks in Spanish class. We broke down the sections of the painting while viewing a <b>photocopied version on an 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper.</b> A few months later, I was fortunate enough to travel to el Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía and see the painting for myself. A <b>small, reproduced version of the painting sitting on a desk with voices traveling about the room</b> was how I had become used to seeing Guernica. In la Reina Sofía, it was striking. The painting was <b>massive, carefully hung against a blank white wall, with utter silence surrounding it.</b> Seeing Guernica in this context gave it a completely different feel. The painting <b>spoke for itself</b> rather than a group of uneducated teens trying to assign it meaning.
